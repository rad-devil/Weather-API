# Weather-API

This program "Weather.py" is designed to graphically output the current weather based on the current location of the user. This feature could also be disabled in which case the user inputs the city location and the weather of that city is displayed.
Respective header files such as PIL,datetime,json and requests needs to be installed. There are two additional files that are used (arial.ttf and sky-background.png) which are also included in this repository. These files should be downloaded to the same parent directory "Weather.py" is downloaded to.

The API used is https://openweathermap. Corresponding url including the API key is used for the get request.
